The main() function is always where your program starts running.
#include inserts another file. “.h” files are called “header” files. They contain stuff needed to interface to libraries and code in other “.c” files.
This is a comment. The compiler ignores this.
Blocks of code (“lexical scopes”) are marked by { … }
Print out a message. ‘\n’ means “new line”.
